# Backbase Task
Test cases and Cypress automation

## Manual test cases
For the manual test cases I tried to capture any possible action a user could take in regards to the computer database, some that are very important to the running of the database and some features that you'd expect to work away from the CRUD features. 

Tests 1-7 I feel are the core CRUD related tasks a user would perform, and tests 8-10 are tests that while they don't actually impact the CRUD features, they are still important to the running of the application. 

## Cypress automation regression tests
I felt that all ten of the test cases that I made would qualify for regression testing as if I was an end user of the application all things tested would contribute to my user experience
